# Cursor Work Log

## Initial SQLite3 SFDC Replica Guide Creation
- Created SQLite3 SFDC Replica rule (03-sqlite3-sfdc-replica.mdc) with:
  - Database setup instructions
  - Table creation patterns matching Salesforce objects
  - Comprehensive indexing strategy for all query-relevant columns
  - Data import patterns using transactions and prepared statements
  - Performance considerations and maintenance tips

## Bash Import Examples Update
- Updated SQLite3 SFDC Replica rule with bash import examples instead of JavaScript:
  - Added sf CLI command to export data as CSV
  - Used SQLite3 shell commands for CSV import with transactions
  - Added example for complex imports using SQL scripts 

# Salesforce Query Tools Development Log

## Project: SFDC Query Tool

### Work Completed:
- Created `describe-objects.sh` script to get field information for specified Salesforce objects
- Created `query-objects.sh` script to query data from specified Salesforce objects
- Created `sfdc-utils.sh` with shared utility functions
- Set up scripts to work with the following objects: User, Opportunity, Account, Contact, Lead
- Configured scripts to use environment variable for target org with PROD as default

### Next Steps:
- Enhance scripts to dynamically add sObjects
- Add data export capabilities 
- Implement filtering options 

# Log of SFDC Query Tool Enhancements (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Summary

Reviewed the bash scripts (`sfdc-utils.sh`, `describe-objects.sh`, `query-objects.sh`, `sfdc-data-tool.sh`) and applied several enhancements focused on robustness, usability, and maintainability.

## Changes Made

1.  **Error Handling (`set -eo pipefail`)**: Added `set -eo pipefail` to the top of all scripts to ensure they exit immediately on errors, unset variables, or pipe failures.
2.  **Prerequisite Checks**: 
    *   Added `check_sf_cli` function to `sfdc-utils.sh` and called it early in all executable scripts (`describe-objects.sh`, `query-objects.sh`, `sfdc-data-tool.sh`).
    *   Added `check_jq` function to `sfdc-utils.sh` to check for `jq` installation once. Modified `clean_json` to use this check, reducing redundant warnings. Called `check_jq` in scripts that use `clean_json` (`describe-objects.sh`, `query-objects.sh`).
3.  **Argument Parsing & Validation**:
    *   Replaced generic `show_usage` in `sfdc-utils.sh` with specific usage functions (`show_describe_usage`, `show_query_usage`, `show_main_usage`) in each respective script.
    *   Added handling for unknown command-line options in all executable scripts.
    *   Added validation for `--limit` (must be positive integer) and `--format` (must be `json` or `csv`) arguments in `query-objects.sh` and `sfdc-data-tool.sh`.
    *   Added conflict check between `--describe` and `--query` flags in `sfdc-data-tool.sh`.
4.  **Script Execution & Flow**:
    *   Modified `sfdc-data-tool.sh` to pass common arguments (`--org`) and query-specific arguments (`--limit`, `--format`) explicitly to sub-scripts using arrays, rather than relying on environment variable exports.
    *   Added checks for the exit status of `sf` commands and sub-script calls (`describe-objects.sh`, `query-objects.sh`).
    *   Added error messages and cleanup (e.g., removing partially created files) on failure.
5.  **Code Clarity & Consistency**:
    *   Added comments to structure scripts (Initialization, Variables, Functions, Argument Parsing, Main Logic).
    *   Improved log/echo messages for better user feedback.
    *   Standardized output filenames to use lowercase object names (`describe-objects.sh`, `query-objects.sh`).
    *   Refined `TARGET_ORG` handling to prioritize command-line arguments over environment variables over script defaults.
    *   Improved `get_fields_for_object` in `query-objects.sh` to provide a warning if default fields aren't found.

## Next Steps / Potential Future Enhancements

*   Consider removing the default `TARGET_ORG="PROD"` from `sfdc-utils.sh` or making it more configurable.
*   Evaluate the efficiency of `validate_object` - could object validation be done more efficiently?
*   Move the `DEFAULT_FIELDS` array in `query-objects.sh` to a separate configuration file.
*   Add more comprehensive unit/integration tests.
*   Implement more sophisticated logging (e.g., log levels, log file output).

## SQLite Replica Script Initialization
- Created initial `scripts/setup_sfdc_replica.sh` based on rule `03-sqlite3-sfdc-replica.mdc`.
- Includes structure for initializing DB, creating tables, indexing, importing data, and optimizing.
- Added command-line arguments for target org and DB file.
- Integrated with `sfdc-utils.sh` and included placeholders (`TODO`) for integrating `describe-objects.sh` and `query-objects.sh` (or direct `sf` calls) for schema generation and data fetching.
- Added a TODO for `check_sqlite3` prerequisite check in `sfdc-utils.sh`.

## Refactor SQLite Replica Script for CSV Import
- Modified `scripts/setup_sfdc_replica.sh` to primarily handle CSV imports.
- Removed direct Salesforce interaction commands (`create`, `index`, `import`).
- Added new command `import-csv <SObject> <CSV_FILE>`.
- `import-csv` function now:
  - Reads CSV header to define table schema (all `TEXT`, `Id` as PK if exists).
  - Creates the table (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`).
  - Imports data using SQLite `.import` command.
  - Calls `index_table` after import.
- `index_table` function now:
  - Uses `PRAGMA table_info` to get columns.
  - Creates indexes on common fields (`Name`, `LastModifiedDate`, `CreatedDate`) and potential foreign keys (fields ending in `Id`).
- Updated argument parsing and usage instructions.
- Ensured `check_sqlite3` (already present in `sfdc-utils.sh`) is called.

## Simplify Indexing Logic
- Updated `index_table` function in `scripts/setup_sfdc_replica.sh`.
- Changed logic to create an index for *all* columns obtained via `PRAGMA table_info`, except for the column designated as the primary key (which SQLite indexes automatically).
- Added quoting to identifiers in `CREATE INDEX` statement for robustness. 

# Salesforce Query Tool Analysis and Enhancement

## Project Overview
The Salesforce Query Tool is a collection of scripts for:
1. Describing Salesforce objects (schema/fields)
2. Querying Salesforce object data
3. Creating a SQLite replica of Salesforce data

## Initial State Analysis

### Scripts Inventory
- `sfdc-data-tool.sh` - Main script orchestrating describe/query operations
- `describe-objects.sh` - Script for describing Salesforce object schemas
- `query-objects.sh` - Script for querying Salesforce object data
- `sfdc-utils.sh` - Shared utility functions
- `setup_sfdc_replica.sh` - Script for setting up SQLite database with Salesforce data

### Identified Issues
- Missing output directory
- No full end-to-end integration between query and database setup
- Missing logging functions in utils script
- No streamlined workflow from Salesforce to SQLite

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Created Output Directory**
   - Created `output` directory to store query results and database files

2. **Added Missing Utility Functions**
   - Added logging functions to `sfdc-utils.sh`:
     - `log_info`
     - `log_success`
     - `log_warning`
     - `log_error`

3. **Created Integrated Workflow Script**
   - Created `sfdc-to-sqlite.sh` which:
     - Combines all operations (describe, query, import) in one script
     - Provides flexible options to skip individual steps
     - Automatically finds and imports the latest query results
     - Handles database initialization and optimization

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with:
     - New script information
     - Complete workflow documentation
     - SQLite prerequisite
     - Examples for the new integrated workflow

## Final State
The project now has a complete end-to-end workflow to query Salesforce objects and create a SQLite replica with a single command, making it much more user-friendly and efficient.
