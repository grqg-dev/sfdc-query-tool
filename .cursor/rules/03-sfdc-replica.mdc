# SFDC Replica Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use our local Salesforce data replica system. The system has extracts data from Salesforce and stores it in a SQLite database for local use and querying.

## Database Schema

Schema: [db.schema](mdc:output/db.schema)

The database schema is dynamically created based on the Salesforce objects being queried. Each Salesforce object becomes a table in the SQLite database with the same name. Field types are mostly mapped to SQLite TEXT for compatibility, with some basic type mapping:

- Boolean fields (Is*/Has* pattern or boolean type in metadata) → BOOLEAN
- Most other fields → TEXT

The system automatically creates indexes on all fields to optimize queries.

## Querying the SQLite Database

You can directly query the SQLite database:

```bash
sqlite3 output/sfdc-replica.db "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account LIMIT 10;"
```
